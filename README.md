# pizza-menu
This project is a simple and interactive Pizza Menu Website where users can explore different pizza options with details such as ingredients, prices, and availability. The goal of the project is to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (and later expand with frameworks if needed) while building a user-friendly and visually appealing menu.
